In EDUC 678/689 (Internship), I had the opportunity to help my mentor teacher create a newsletter that included an introduction about the new interns that would be helping in the second grade classsroom at Beattie Elementary School. I learned about how appropriate newsletters are to be sent out to parents - using both electronic email formats and paper copies that get sent home in each child's Friday folder. They give information about what the student's will be learning the following week in terms of literacy, mathematics, science, and their specials schedule for the week. I learned how important it is to be concise with these newsletters and provide solely the important information that parents need to know.
