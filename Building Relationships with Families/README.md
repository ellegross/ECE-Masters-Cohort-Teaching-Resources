In EDUC 678/689 (Internship), I had the opportunity to help my mentor teacher create a newsletter that included an introduction about the new interns that would be helping in the second grade classsroom at Beattie Elementary School. I learned about how appropriate newsletters are to be sent out to parents - using both electronic email formats and paper copies that get sent home in each child's Friday folder. They give information about what the student's will be learning the following week in terms of literacy, mathematics, science, and their specials schedule for the week. I learned how important it is to be concise with these newsletters and provide solely the important information that parents need to know. (Newsletter to Families).

Here are a few helpful websites that provide useful information about how to write good newsletters to send to families of students-

Additionally, I have included a Sample Newsletter to show how clear and concise it should be for families to be able to access easily. 

Second, I learned through my student teaching (EDUC 687E) experience that the tone and voice that you speak to families in affects their perception of you as their child's teacher. It is important to word your sentences correctly and ensure they are not misinterpreting your words - especially when it is through email or some form of electronic communication. I have included a PDF that provides 12 tips for teachers when speaking with parents through email. This link https://owlcation.com/academia/Teachers-How-to-Make-a-Difficult-Phone-Call-to-a-Parent includes more tips for communicating with families and parents about difficult topics and includes a script you could utilize as a framework. I have also included a parent teacher communication questionaire, which may be useful to send out in the beginning of the school year to have contact information and know which means of communication each family prefers.

Finally, when building relationships with families, it is important to invite them into the classroom when the opportunity exists. This was observed through EDUC 687E - in my student teaching experience. I sat in on a few parent teacher conferences and it really allowed me the chance to get to know where my students were coming from and get to know them on a more personal level. I noticed that after meeting most of their parents, the students came back with a more trusting attitude towards me as their teacher. This website shares 24 different activities that could be designed for your student's families to come into the classroom, alongside helpful advice and tips in how to increase family involvement and build those positive relationships - https://www.kickboardforschools.com/family-engagement-communication/24-activities-to-get-parents-involved-in-schools/
