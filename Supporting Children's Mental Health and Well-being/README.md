There are various ways to support and provide for our students overall well-being. Fortunately, the courses throughout this program provided physical resources as well as real-life experiences (practicum and student teaching) to practice what we've learned. Specifically, classes such as EDUC 625 (Contexts of Schooling) and 687E (Student Teaching) were most helpful when learning how to support our students social and emotional well-being.


While reading ***Culturally Responsive Teaching and The Brain*** by Zaretta Hammond in EDUC 625, I learned important themes and ideas for supporting students overall wellbeing. I was able to implement what I learned throughout my experience student teaching.

1. **Community Building**- Providing a space or enviornment where learners can flourish socially and intellectually. Students are more willing to take risks (growth mindset) in settings that mirror their interests/ understandings (be intentional with classroom set up).
2. **Relationships**- Gain students trust (peace circle, one-on-one, walk and talks).
3. **Being Flexible**- What does the student need in that moment? (cozy corner, snack, break). 
 
Every morning I would include a quick 2-5 minute mindfulness moment using either our breathing ball or a Go Noodle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzXFPh6CPIDuring. In addition during student teaching I was able to encourage students social and emotional growth by reiterating our classroom ***calming strategies*** such as, take a deep breath, walk away, saying "please stop", ignore, and find a new friend. 

When a student consistently displayed a particular behavior (crying, walking around the room, shouting out, refusal) and was unable to use their calming strategies mentioned earlier, extra support was likely necessary. Throughout student teaching I was able to use a reinforcement and reward motivation survey created by The Psychologist Counselor (available on Teachers Pay Teachers) to attempt and understand the needs of the previous mentioned students.
